Whether you\u2019re engineering modern applications with JavaScript or designing and implementing PHP web applications, your software engineering success hinges on your ability to innovate and achieve your client\u2019s expectations. In that same way, you want to create a software engineer resume which achieves your goal: to land your dream job. At Enhancv, our job is to create resumes which allow you to get your foot in the door and to gain a highly sought after interview. In this article, we will provide you with: Before you go on, there are other resume examples with guides that can be relevant for you: Software engineer resume example What does this resume example do well? How to format a software engineer's resume As a software engineer, you should approach your resume like you would a line of code. When you format your code, you\u2019re not just doing it for aesthetic reasons, but you\u2019re doing it to enhance readability and make the codebase easier to maintain. In that same way, a properly formatted resume can enhance the readability of your resume for a potential hiring manager. In fact, by just making small tweaks to your resume, you can present yourself in a much more appealing way and potentially position yourself to get that much sought-after interview. Below, you\u2019ll find some helpful tips to keep in mind when you\u2019reformatting your resume:            Targeting Canada? \u2013Keep in mind their resume layout may differ from others. Drop your resume here orchoose a file. PDF & DOCX only. Max 2MB file size.                       How to write your software engineer resume experience Your resume experience section will be the first thing that a recruiter looks for when they scan your resume. They\u2019ll scrutinize the contributions that you made in your previous role, checking to see what impact you made. That\u2019s why you should bolster your experience and skills with real, quantifiable examples from your career. Below, you\u2019ll find a list of two experience sections. One of them will be the correct way to fill out an experience section, while the other will be a resume section that falls below expectations. Use both examples as a guideline to create your own: What\u2019s the issue with this resume experience section? There\u2019s not a single quantifiable example here. What exactly did implementing Agile methodologies do in your previous job? There\u2019s nothing here to show the impact that the applicant made. Also, some of the weak verbs should be changed to active, engaging verbs. The verb \u2018helped\u2019 is a weak verb, which could be shifted to \u2018collaborated\u2019 or just simply \u2018implemented\u2019. What does this do right? There are quantifiable examples scattered throughout this resume experience section, and this helps to show the impact that the applicant has made in their previous roles. Not only that, but the applicant uses unique keywords of specific programming languages and open-source server platforms which would help their resume make it through a scan by applicant tracking systems (ATS). Start every one of your bullet points with a power verb to make them super impactful. Examples of power words include collaborated, developed, advocated, facilitated, and transformed. It\u2019s important to quantify the impact you\u2019ve made in previous roles because you can add credibility to the claims that you make. Chances are, as a software engineer, you\u2019ve spent a great deal of time creating and developing software, fixing bugs, and creating programs and applications that can benefit people. But you likely have spent very little time reflecting on the impact that you\u2019ve made. Potential hiring managers don\u2019t want to see a bland list of the things that you\u2019ve done. They want to see real-world examples of the difference you\u2019ve made. In order to do this, use the PAR (Problem-Action-Result) method to refine your contributions. List a specific problem and then share the actions you took to achieve a specific result. Below, you\u2019ll find a list of the top quantifiable achievements to include on your resume: How to list your hard skills and soft skills on your resume In the IT field, you\u2019ll likely find it easier to go into detail about the hard (technical skills) that you possess. You have a technical education which has allowed you to develop your coding and programming languages to become proficient in them. No doubt when someone asks what you do for a living, you might list off several technical skills you have and explain how that fits into your role in a company. These technical skills may form the core of your experience, but you also possess soft (also known as people) skills. Whenever you collaborate with an interdisciplinary team filled with marketing experts, managers, and research and development professionals, you have to use communication skills to explain the decisions and actions you\u2019ve taken. Below, you\u2019ll find two lists. The first one lists all the hard skills a software engineer should include on their resume. The second will include all the soft skills to include.                                                 How to list your certifications and education on your resume In the IT field, possessing the right education and certifications can make all the difference in finding the right job. In fact, if you possess the right educational background and certifications, you may be able to win job offers over more experienced software engineers. Here\u2019s what you need to include when listing youreducation on your resume:                                               How to write your software developer resume summary or objective There is a big difference between a resume summary on a resume objective. A resume objective, also known as an objective statement, is a short, position-focused statement that describes the value that you could add to the position you\u2019re applying for. A resume objective tends to be used more for those who are new to the field, or those without as much experience. You can use bullet points in your resume objective to help break up a large paragraph of text. It also helps to draw the eye to each of the individual unique skills you possess. In contrast, a professional summary goes into a little more detail than a resume objective does. Resume summaries go into more depth about how each unique set of skills you possess will aid the company. Using real-world, quantifiable examples, a resume summary should effectively build your case on why your experience shows you\u2019ll be the best candidate to fill the position. Resume summaries can be used by those who have more experience under their belt. Let\u2019s first examine a couple of resume objectives for software engineers, and see what they do bad and well. One major issue with his resume objective is that it lacks specific details about the technical skills that the applicant possesses. Don\u2019t be afraid to explain individual skills that you highlight later on in your resume. What does this example do right? It\u2019s a lot more specific, going into more detail about the skills and abilities that the applicant possesses. Not only does it mention programming languages, but it also mentions their unique background in database management and cloud technologies. Now, let\u2019s move on to resume summaries and focus on how to do them well and what to avoid. This resume summary doesn\u2019t have the same impact as the one you will read below. It misses the unique programming languages that the applicant possesses, as well as not possessing powerful words. For what could be a great resume summary, it falls lifeless and flat. Conversely, not only does it showcase all the unique programming languages and skills the applicant possesses, but it also shows that the applicant is looking for a new challenge. This shows someone who is driven to create an impact and to innovate. Cover letter matching your software engineer resume Cover letters are important because they allow a hiring manager to learn a little more about you than what your resume can offer. In your cover letter, be sure to go into more depth about the skills and experience you possess, while also showing how you are interested in the position you\u2019re applying for. Below, you can find a list of tips to help you craft your cover letter: Check oursoftware engineer cover letter here. Software Engineer resume examples By Experience You're likely to gain more software development knowledge during your initial months on the job than throughout four years as a computer science major. Both technical and non-technical recruiters appreciate real project experience, as it demonstrates your ability to thrive in a production environment, collaborate with a team, and adhere to guidelines. If your work history is sparse, focus on presenting your experience through software projects. Side applications, contributions to open-source code, and even relevant Fiverr gigs can give you a competitive advantage over candidates with less experience. Your GitHub profile can be a wildcard in the hiring process. Some recruiters may scrutinize it to make their decision, while others might disregard it completely. Prepare for the possibility that someone will review your GitHub page. What will they find? Unnecessary comments? An empty profile? Regardless of whether the code was written three or five years ago, your work will be evaluated based on today's standards. Include your GitHub link on your resume only if you believe it adds value. Otherwise, it could work against you. Mid-level software engineers are indeed the \"workhorses\" of the programming world. They deliver significant impact through routine code, optimize their workflows precisely, and exhibit excellent coding habits. Highlight the following qualities in the context of your software projects to present yourself in the best light: Beyond operating independently at a highly-skilled level, senior software engineers are also capable of leading teams and serving as mentors. When applying for senior positions, concentrate on your team's achievements and collaboration, rather than your personal accomplishments. Tech companies seek senior software engineers who can effectively guide less-experienced staff. Examine the size of your target company's software department and emphasize experience with teams of comparable sizes. Showcase your successes as a leader and prove your ability to consistently solve company problems. Structure parts of your experience using a challenge-solution-business outcome framework to attract the attention of your dream company.
