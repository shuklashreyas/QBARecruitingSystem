# Introduction

From January to June 2025, I completed a co-op at Quantum Business Advisory (QBA) through Northeastern University’s Computer Science CO-OP program. During this time, I collaborated with a team of software engineers to architect and build an AI-driven recruitment platform that streamlines candidate sourcing, screening, and engagement.

## Large Scope Overview

###  Backend

1. **Foundation & Architecture**  
   - Chose **FastAPI** + Uvicorn for a high-performance, asynchronous REST API.  
   - Structured the code into logical modules (`routes/`, `models/`, `database/`, `auth/`).

2. **Persistence & Data Modeling**  
   - Designed **SQLAlchemy** models for `User`, `Job`, `Application` (with cascade deletes).  
   - Managed schema changes via **Alembic migrations**.  
   - Deployed on **PostgreSQL**, with environment-specific connection strings.

3. **Core CRUD & Business Logic**  
   - Implemented full **CRUD** for jobs (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`), tying each job to its creator.  
   - Added **input validation** at the Pydantic-schema level.  
   - Introduced **custom HTTP error handling** for robust responses.

4. **Authentication & Authorization**  
   - Built **JWT**-based auth endpoints (`/auth/register`, `/auth/token`).  
   - Enforced **role-based access control** (admin/recruiter/applicant) on protected routes.

5. **Advanced API Features**  
   - **Filtering & Pagination**: query by title, company, date; implemented database indexes for performance.  
   - **Search & Sorting**: sort listings by deadline, compensation, etc.  
   - **CORS** & **Swagger UI**: enabled cross-origin frontend calls and auto-generated API docs.

6. **Testing & Deployment Prep**  
   - Wrote **pytest** suites and used **Postman** for endpoint validation.  
   - Prepared the codebase for cloud deployment (Heroku/Railway/AWS).

7. **AI & Automation Hooks**  
   - Integrated **BERT-based resume-scoring** and an **email/workflow automation** layer.  
   - Exposed endpoints for **resume parsing** and **auto-filling job templates**, including “Copy from LinkedIn.”

### Frontend

1. **Tech Stack & Styling**  
   - Built as a **React** SPA using **Tailwind CSS** and **shadcn/ui** components.  
   - Emphasized a **mobile-first**, **accessible** design.

2. **Role-Aware Interfaces**  
   - **Applicant View**:  
     - **Login & Create Account** pages with JWT token storage.  
     - Multi-section **application form** dynamically generated from each job’s `other_materials` and custom questions.  
     - “View My Applications” dashboard showing status (Pending · Accepted · Rejected).

   - **Recruiter View**:  
     - **Job Listings** page with “Create New Job” and **Edit** buttons (hidden from applicants).  
     - **Job Detail** panel: left side shows detailed JD; right side lists applications by status with real-time updates and in-place accept/reject actions.

3. **Data Integration & State**  
   - Used **Axios**/Fetch to call backend endpoints, with **Context API** (or Redux) for global state (auth tokens, job data).  
   - Implemented **React Router** for client-side navigation.

4. **Interactive Enhancements**  
   - **Filters**: title, location, work mode; **sorting** by deadline and compensation.  
   - **Highlighting**: visual cues for jobs nearing their application deadline.  
   - **Responsive Tables**: sortable, paginated job tables that render gracefully when empty.

5. **Component Design & Iteration**  
   - Wireframed key screens, then broke them into reusable components (e.g., `JobTable`, `JobForm`, `AuthForm`).  
   - Gradually polished UI (button alignment, form layouts, dynamic sections) based on user roles.

6. **Testing & Tooling**  
   - Switched from raw `curl` to **Postman** for API debugging.  
   - Addressed ESLint/TypeScript warnings and resolved module/import issues for a stable developer experience.


## Prerequisites & Notes

**Status:** Approximately 75% complete with a polished, responsive UI.  
**Disclaimer:** A handful of features are still under development and a few minor bugs remain.
