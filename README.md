# # QBA Recurting System

conda activate job-management
/opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniconda/base/envs/job-management/bin/python

This is a **FastAPI-based job management system** that allows users to register, authenticate, and manage job listings. It includes user authentication with JWT tokens and CRUD operations for job postings.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Register, login, and obtain JWT tokens.
- **Job Management**:
  - Create, update, delete jobs (authenticated users only).
  - Retrieve all jobs.
  - Retrieve jobs created by the logged-in user.

### 1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/job-management.git
cd job-management
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment

```sh
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scriptsctivate`
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set up the database

```sh

```

## Technologies Used

- **FastAPI** - API framework
- **SQLAlchemy** - ORM
- **Alembic** - Migrations
- **PostgreSQL** - Database
- **JWT** - Authentication

## Future Improvements

- Role-based access control
- Job search and filtering
- Pagination for large job listings
